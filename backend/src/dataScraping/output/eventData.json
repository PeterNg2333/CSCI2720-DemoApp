Anna Karina, directed by her future husband, plays a stripper, a text-book case of an object of male gaze. But the joint where she strips is presented by French New Wave genius Jean-Luc Godard with a certain utopic vision, where women who make a living displaying their bodies are not treated with contempt, where the male gaze is cast more as a healthy exercise of vive la difference acknowledging gender attraction than as exploitative power. The director calls the film a neo-realist musical, orchestrating everything with pop-art schemes like cartoons and splashes of primary colors, self-reflexively challenging the fourth wall with the kind of 1960s rebellious spirit that eventually gave rise to Laura Mulvey’s discovery of the male gaze. And Karina looks back at the gaze, literally and figuratively, with sensuousness, intelligence and humor, realizing this playful but also sophisticated masterpiece with her real-life lover, hand-in-hand and eye-to-eye. A Third-Wave feminist film made even before the Second Wave emerged?\n\n11/12 (Sun) 11:30am Cinema, Hong Kong Film Archive\nPost-screening Talk in Cantonese by Sonia Au"},"urlc":{"_cdata":"https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/fp/tc/details.html?id=4601"},"urle":{"_cdata":"https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/fp/en/details.html?id=4601"},"tagenturlc":{"_cdata":"http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/tc/ticket/index.html"},"tagenturle":{"_cdata":"http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ticket/index.html"},"remarkc":{"_cdata":"法語對白，中英文字幕"},"remarke":{"_cdata":"In French with Chinese and English subtitles"},"enquiry":{"_cdata":"2734 2900"},"fax":{},"email":{},"saledate":{"_cdata":"2022-11-16 12:11:00.000"},"interbook":{"_cdata":"Y"},"presenterorgc":{"_cdata":"康樂及文化事務署主辦"},"presenterorge":{"_cdata":"Presented by Leisure and Cultural Services Department"},"prog_image":{},"detail_image1":{},"detail_image2":{},"detail_image3":{},"detail_image4":{},"detail_image5":{},"video_link":{},"video2_link":{},"submitdate":{"_cdata":"2022-11-23 10:41:36.000"}},{"_attributes":{"id":"144417"},"titlec":{"_cdata":"《列車女賊》─ 歐洲女神、美國烈女"},"titlee":{"_cdata":"\"Boxcar Bertha\"- Fest of Belles and Queens: Actresses European and Hollywood"},"cat1":{"_cdata":"inc4"},"cat2":{"_cdata":"inc4sc5"},"predateC":{"_cdata":"2023年1月14日 (六) 下午4時10分"},"predateE":{"_cdata":"14 January 2023 (Sat) 4:10pm"},"progtimec":{"_cdata":"88分鐘"},"progtimee":{"_cdata":"88 mins"},"venueid":{"_cdata":"8263"},"agelimitc":{},"agelimite":{},"pricec":{"_cdata":"$90"},"pricee":{"_cdata":"$90"},"descc":{"_cdata":"馬田史高西斯成名之前也拍過B級片！拍竣第一部獨立長片但仍未製作一鳴驚人的《窮街陋巷》 （Mean Streets, 1973）前，尚未成名的大師，泡製了主要針對非主流市場的《列車女賊》。當時荷里活正值轉型期，部份小型公司，為營造新氣象，積極給予新人機會。決意發展電影事業的馬田史高西斯，夥拍「剝削電影」教父羅渣哥曼（Roger Corman），拍出了首部商業作品。\n\n一如其他七十年代「剝削電影」，《列車女賊》也沿用了具票房保證的「性愛、 暴力、時評」公式。故事發生在美國南部，來自鄉村的女子與工會領袖聯手，洗劫火車與銀行，情節遠溯美式「法外英雄」神話、近源數年前十分賣座的《雌雄大盜》（1967）。活在社會邊緣的女子，違抗性的生活方式，吻合了戰後嬰兒潮世代那種被普及文化過濾後的軟性反主流意識，而她與戀人的愛情與事業關係，亦展現了那個重新思考傳統、固有價值動搖的年代中，性別政治的演變面貌。\n\n《列車女賊》可能是未來大師未臻上乘之作，但仍充滿他的招牌元素，如天主教情懷、男性焦慮和對女性的情慾投射等。要回溯馬田史高西斯邁向大師的歷程，這是不能或缺的文本。\n\n設映後談 | 講者歐嘉麗 | 粵語主講"},"desce":{"_cdata":"This is a crude commercial film made on the cheap by a master in the making.

W. Murnau），移居荷里活後卻當起了B級片導演，多產但不為人所注意，直至退休後才華方為影評人發現。《歧路》承傳德國表現主義的映像風格，配合了美國流行文化、二戰後的人心黑暗與不安惶恐，營造出偏執、焦慮的精神狀態。低成本製作電影儘管資源匱乏，無阻導演創意，如煙霧的運用，一方面營造神秘氣氛，另一方面掩蓋佈景與裝飾的不足。最後更以罕見的殺人手法，為罪惡電影添上另闢蹊徑的一筆。"},"desce":{"_cdata":"Detour is one of the darkest installments of the American road movie. A textbook case of low-budget filmmaking, it is a road movie that takes place largely on the front seat of a car, rendering the road at once open and claustrophobic. Al Roberts is a musician trained in the classics but plays jazz in a smoky club in New York, back when jazz was far from what it is today. He decides one day to hitchhike to California, looking for a new life and, predictably, finding a nightmare. Much of that nightmare is in the form of a woman he meets on the road. Vera is a strong woman, mean and cynical and determined, one of the most memorable femme fatales of film noir.

A textbook case of low-budget filmmaking, it is a road movie that takes place largely on the front seat of a car, rendering the road at once open and claustrophobic.

He decides one day to hitchhike to California, looking for a new life and, predictably, finding a nightmare. Much of that nightmare is in the form of a woman he meets on the road.

Actually, he should’ve doubled the number, for there are two women in the film who were more men!\n\nJohnny Guitar is a low-budget western from Republic Pictures, a minor outfit in Hollywood’s studio era. Directed by Nicholas Ray and co-written by Ben Maddow – uncredited, because of political blacklisting – the film turns the western genre upside down, subverting conventions to generate brand-new meaning. One remarkable subversion is the reversal of gender roles, animating a contentious battle between two strong women, saloon-casino owner Vienna and Emma, a bossy character who calls herself a “cattle baron”, not baroness.

That the man behind a film portraying female sexual psychology with such intimacy and terrifying power could commit such atrocities is at once horrific and illuminating, that humans can be driven by complex and sometimes contradicting impulses. Catherine Deneuve, sexual revolution’s ice goddess, plays a lonely woman consumed by sexual repression and fear of men. Her child-like vulnerability wrapped inside a gorgeous body, she’s an enticing embodiment of a fetishism at once perverse, cruel and pathologic. Her many struggles are set against the gorgeous indulgence of swinging London, providing at once powerful narrative contrast and also profound commentary on the hidden perils of 1960s sexual liberation. This is a story of a woman looking at herself.

The company was started by a group of established filmmakers who, worried about the blatant commercialization of Hong Kong cinema, banded together to make films of better quality. It revolutionized the industry and became one of the most important film companies of all time. And such genius is the system that the profit-oriented industry would have enough room to allow for these idealists to rewrite history.\n\nThe titled belle of Beauty Raised from the Dead is played by Pak Yin, a major 1950s star and one of Union’s founders. An accomplished actress who played the hapless but gritty woman in countless films, she had a sensuous side exceptional for her times, her nasal voice adding a touch of subtle sexiness to her otherwise stoic persona. Her scene washing her feet in the rain in Beauty is one of the most sensuous moments in Hong Kong film history. The story is based on the Ming Dynasty classic Peony Pavilion but transplanted to Republic times by renowned director Lee Sun-fung, who tells it with poetic elegance, striking a balance between drama and mood, tradition and modernity. No wonder award-winning director Tsai Ming-Liang considers this one of his favorite films.\n\nPost-screening talk in Cantonese by Kenny Ng and Sam

From the Six Dynasties and the Southern Tang to the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, there were several peaks of cultural development. When the Ming dynasty ended and the Qing dynasty began, Jinling, as the remaining capital from the previous dynasty, became a symbol of reminiscence and a place to pay tribute to the Ming motherland. Because of its cultural traditions, geographical environment and economy, Jinling attracted many local and expatriate painters, as well as adherents of the former dynasty, courtesans, collectors, patrons and publishers. Their relationships and interactions developed into a complex and unique scenario in painting circles. Many painters emphasised individualism or integrated styles from different periods and geographical regions. They combined their life experiences in Jinling with natural landscapes, resulting in many paintings from the era that are realistic and spiritual, romantic and bizarre.\n\nIn this lecture, our guest speaker, Mr Szeto Yuen-kit, will talk about Jinling, the painting metropolis in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. He will also analyse how the special painting styles developed and Jinling’s influence on painting circles in later ages, and explore with the participants the most active cultural metropolis and artistic hub of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties.\n\nSpeaker: Mr Szeto Yuen-kit (Former Chief Curator (Chih Lo Lou &amp; Wu Guanzhong Collections) of the Hong Kong Museum of Art)\n\nIn association with “The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: Women and Femininity in Ancient China – Treasures from the Nanjing Museum” exhibition"},"urlc":{"_cdata":"https://hk.heritage.museum/zh_TW/web/hm/eventsactivities/programmes/nanjing.html"},"urle":{"_cdata":"https://hk.heritage.museum/en_US/web/hm/eventsactivities/programmes/nanjing.html"},"tagenturlc":{},"tagenturle":{},"remarkc":{"_cdata":"無須預先報名。劇院將於活動開始前15分鐘開放予觀眾入場，名額有限，先到先得，額滿即止。*確實入場名額將按屆時社交距離措施而定。"},"remarke":{"_cdata":"No registration is required.

Yeung concurrently teaches at the School of Music of the South China Normal University, supervising students on Master's degree programmes of dizi performance and ethnomusicology, and is on the faculty of the School of Music of HKAPA supervising Master's degree students. \n\nThe Chinese title of the recital is a homonym for \"homesickness\"; it is also the title of Yeung’s original composition, Poetic Homeland.  The strong nostalgic mood thus expressed comes from Yeung’s native connection with the Chaozhou-Shantou region in Guangdong province.  He has therefore chosen several poems with subjects on Chaozhou-Shantou, set them to music and created a song cycle.  The other pieces in the programme, which includes A Lyrical Melody of the Grassland, The Swallows Have Returned, The Sea of South China, Cantonese Bamboo and Four Movements on Northern Shaanxi, are the result of his more than 20 years of search for mentoring in dizi performance techniques in various parts of the Mainland China.
